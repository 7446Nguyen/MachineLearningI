## Respository Contents
**Classificaiton and Regression** 
- IEEE formatted project proposal and final reports are contained here.

**Exploratory Data Analysis**   
- All raw data and performance data can be accessed in the folder.

**Logistic Regression and SVM**   
- Files related to data manipulation, database scripting, and transformation are located here.  Data manipulation and transformation were performed using Juypter Notebook for all ETL processes, and RStudio was used for inital data preparation.  MySQL was used to create schemas and tables for the relational database, while a referential model containing collections and documents for NoSQL database were created using MongoDB.
