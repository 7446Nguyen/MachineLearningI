# Machine Learning I
## Hello and Welcome!
The intent of this repository is demonstrate competency with preprocessing, hyper-parameter tuning, training and testing, and execution of fundamental machine learning algorithms. When browsing files within the repository please open files labeled **FINAL**.  Other files that are not labeled **FINAL** are prior iterations that were used to get to the final file.

## Repository Contents
Data for the algorithms below used in this project was obtained from: https://www.kaggle.com/c/loanapprove 

**Classification and Regression** 
- Utilize Naive Bayes, KNN, and Random Forest classification to identify and predict loans that failed or succeeded; and KNN, Random Forest, and Linear regression to predict the value of a charge-off for loans that failed

**Exploratory Data Analysis**   
- Provide basic analysis of the dataset by identifying duplicates, NAs, data types, and identify interesting trends.  This file is dedicated to EDA, however, is present in every ML project in this repository

**Logistic Regression and SVM**   
- Utilize Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines (with stochastic gradient descent) to classify loans that failed or were successful

**Clustering** 
- Utilize KModes and Agglomerative Clustering to provide segmentation of loan failures.  Exploratory data analysis for each cluster is provided to better understand the characteristics of each cluster.
